# SkyBlockPlus
Welcome to SkyBlockPlus! This project was inspired by the 1.19 Skyblock YouTube series published by Ilmango, and aims to recreate that experience for modern Minecraft without strictly requiring the use of any mods.

Add this datapack to a new world during world creation, and watch the magic happen. You will be spawned on a starter island featuring a flat grass platform and a single acacia tree in a random biome in an empty world. Refer to the custom advancement menu(s) for guidance on how to progress through the datapack's custom features, or consult the changes listed below to see what is new!

This datapack offers a custom set of `/trigger` commands to ease the process of locating key biomes and structures without having to enable commands in your world! **Note that if this datapack is run on a server, command blocks must be enabled for these triggers to work.**
